	<!--- bit weird jsDelivr claims this is a CDN but the library seems to imply otherwise 
	e.g. the code is erroring due to the lack of the require statement, 
	and I am not in the mood to bundle the package myself :| 
	I briefly tried treating it as a module but that didn't work 
	^ maybe its cause I stupidy typed "model" rather than module: 
	<script type="model" src="script.js"></script> :| 
	<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ml-svm@2.1.2/src/svm.min.js"></script>

	Ok, so a lot of the libraries I've looked at all use require, despite claiming to be 
	usable within the browser, I believe I should use a NodeJS bundler e.g. Webpack/Babel (maybe Parcel / Vite) to bundle the SVM library with the client side code (similar to how Single Page Apps work), then I'd put that bundled file & an index.html file onto say Gtihub Pages 
	https://www.npmjs.com/package/machine_learning
	https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/uncaught-referenceerror-require-is-not-defined

	I briefly considered writing a script to change the require statements to import statements, 
	but I cannot predict how long this will take, and I think the native browser "import" keyword may require the file to be running on a webserver (where CORS configuration is unlikely to get in the way), and some browsers may not support the ES6 import keyword 
	
	
	Otherwise, I'd likely need to code (or at least copy code from a tutorial etc) my own support vector machine using pure client side JS (ideally ES5) 

	I mean... I guess assuming that require is the only part of NodeJS being used, then 
	hypothetically I can just manually copy & paste the code for each file into the same file 
	and get rid of the require statement, but this is a tedious task and could lead to issues such as clashing variables 

	I don't think requirejs is what I was looking for - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYxzS__5yYQmDD-0A0Jvy27lUnrGIsq9o
